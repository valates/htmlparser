Camp, 1-23-2017, Frank, "President Trump Names January 20, 2017, a National Holiday," http://www.dailywire.com/news/12703/president-trump-names-january-20-2017-national-frank-camp

In a document released Monday, President Donald Trump namedJanuary 20, 2017,"National Day of Patriotic Devotion." The document, clearly not written by the president, due to its grammatical correctness, clear sentence structure, and lack of the word "tremendous," reads in part:
"A new national pride stirs the American soul and inspires the American heart. We are one people, united by a common destiny and a shared purpose...Our Constitution is written on parchment, but it lives in the hearts of the American people. There is no freedom where the people do not believe in it; no law where the people do not follow it; and no peace where the people do not pray for it...
Now, therefore, I, Donald J. Trump, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim January 20, 2017, as National Day of Patriotic Devotion in order to strengthen our bonds to each other and to our country--and to renew the duties of Government to the people."
According to CNBC, while the President of the United States has the authority to create one-day holidays, it takes Congress to create permanent federal holidays. George W. Bush declared September 11, 2002, "Patriot Day." He also called for a "national day of mourning" following Ronald Reagan's death in 2004. Similarly, Barack Obama declared September 11, 2014, "Patriot Day and National Day of Service and Remembrance."
Actually, Trump declaring his inauguration day a national day began, as all stupid things apparently do, with Barack Obama. Obama declared January 20, 2009 "National Day of Renewal and Reconciliation":
As I take the sacred oath of the highest office in the land, I am humbled by the responsibility placed upon my shoulders, renewed by the courage and decency of the American people, and fortified by my faith in an awesome God ... On this Inauguration Day, we are reminded that we are heirs to over two centuries of American democracy, and that this legacy is not simply a birthright - it is a glorious burden. Now it falls to us to come together as a people to carry it forward once more.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim January 20, 2009, a National Day of Renewal and Reconciliation, and call upon all of our citizens to serve one another and the common purpose of remaking this Nation for our new century.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twentieth day of January, in the year of our Lord two thousand nine, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-third.
However, Trump's one-off holiday was declared three days after it was to take place, making it somehow even less than symbolic. In all likelihood, Donald Trump wanted to create the holiday because of the intensely divided condition in which the United States currently stands.
Happy National Day of Patriotic Devotion...three days ago.
